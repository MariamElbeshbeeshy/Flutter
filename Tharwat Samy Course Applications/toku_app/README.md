## 🌟 App Description

The core idea behind Toku is to provide a user-friendly learning experience for beginners. The app organizes common Japanese words and phrases into distinct categories like Family Members, Colors, and common Phrases. Each item in a category is presented with its English translation, Japanese counterpart, a relevant image, and an audio clip to ensure correct pronunciation.
